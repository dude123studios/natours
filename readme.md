## Description

This repository is completely based off of the Udemy Course by Jonas Schmedtmann. Using many new technologies in the backend of the MERN stack, (with pug as frontend), I have a created heavily data modeled, very secure, very beautiful node.js application for a company to manage tours, and for users to buy and review them. The implementation uses the MVC architecture.
